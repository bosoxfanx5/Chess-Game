Notes:
 Circular Dependencies
 
 * Use forward declarations where possible.
 
 * Move any header includes out of a header file and into the corresponding
   cpp file if they are only needed by the cpp file. Easiest way to enforce
   this is to make the #include "myclass.h" the first include in myclass.cpp.
 
 * Introducing interfaces at the point of interaction between separate classes
   can help reduce dependencies.
