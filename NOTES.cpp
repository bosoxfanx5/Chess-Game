Notes:
 Circular Dependencies (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4816698/avoiding-circular-dependencies-of-header-files)
 
 * Use forward declarations where possible.
 
 * Move any header includes out of a header file and into the corresponding
   cpp file if they are only needed by the cpp file. Easiest way to enforce
   this is to make the #include "myclass.h" the first include in myclass.cpp.
 
 * Introducing interfaces at the point of interaction between separate classes
   can help reduce dependencies.
 
 ...depending on your preprocessor capabilities, you can also use:
 
 #pragma once
 
 or
 
 #ifndef MY_HEADER_H
 #define MY_HEADER_H
 your header file
 #endif
