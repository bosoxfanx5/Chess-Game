# Chess-Game
Another early project in my education, this was another project where we were assigned to create a chess game using C++ and Object Oriented design.
The reason for seeing zero commits from my profile, is that this project was predominently developed under synchronous collaboration,
with a person doing the "driving", while the others viewed their screen and provided input. This was a method suggested by our professor
during this specific project.
